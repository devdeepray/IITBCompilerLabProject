NOTES

For assignment:

if left side is array, we need the computation. Hence, registers reqd, 
and will finally give index. On the other hand, if left side is identifier,
in that case, we can directly store. Hence reg requirement is zero. 
How will this be done?? 

For identifier: 

If it is an lvalue, no register requirement
If it is an rvalue, one register requirement
I think it is easier for now to just assume genLCode for id or array
actually puts the exact address .

For array:
Whether lvalue or rvalue, same register requirement



Gencode:
Gencode is never called on const trees


For identifier:

Value:
either local array -> internal offset + ebp
or param array -> need to load onto reg
or primitive -> direct calc is okay

LValue:
either local arary
or param array
or primitive
